# Expertisia
A Django powered website for searching jobs based on the skills a person have and visualizing the skills that appear in most
of the jobs. This helps a person to choose the jobs based on the skills he has and get to know the skills that are of demand
in the market. We have used Django Rest framework and [GoogleCharts API](https://developers.google.com/chart/) for visualization.

The main difference between our project and other job portals can be quoted as
> If they are Matrimonial websites we are building dating an application :P

##Future work
Right now working on implementing recommender systems and trying to integrate with [Project_bi](https://github.com/ambicapramod/project_bi)
for recommending courses for the skills.
